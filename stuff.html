      <h1>My Journey on Web Development</h1>
      <br />
      <h2>Anicration-GUI</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        My first entry into web development. After being frustrated at using
        Tkinter, I decided to choose web dev as a way to get a GUI going. After
        a bit of researching, I found out that GUI on webapps are very easy with
        Bootstrap.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        However, I only knew Python at the time, so I spent some months learning
        HTML before hopping into Django and building my first ever web app.
      </p>

      <h2>vuedj_anigui</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Django gave my the tools needed to create business logic, but it isn't
        what I'm looking for. I'm looking for a Single Page Application, and
        Django it's not exactly cut for it. I needed a page that doesn't reload
        everytime I do something, and so starts my journey on Vue.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        I developed the same application but this time on Vue. It's still served
        by Django.
      </p>
      <img src="/static/vuedj_anigui.jpg" width="800" alt="" />
      <p>
        <em
          >It's very much unfinished. At least it now displays likes and
          retweets!</em
        >
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        This relies on django-manifest-loader to serve the production build of
        Vue. It's also my first foray into Javascript, as I haven't got into
        learning Javascript yet.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Segway: Seemless development between Vue and Django</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        This took me a lot of trail and error to get right. Initially, I wanted
        to quickly be able to develop with the power of Vue's hot reload whilist
        having Django serving the file. This turned out to be a step in the
        wrong direction. I was fumbling with webpacks and django-webpack-loader
        it was a hell of a nightmare.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        In the end, the right answer was not to do that. It was to separate the
        front end from the backend. You can either do CORS/CSP, or you can use
        devServer:proxy on vue.config.js to pass backend's port over if you plan
        on using Django to serve file(also SessionAuthentication).
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Quicktrack</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        This is the first Webapp that I put my full effort into. It's a hutang
        tracking Webapp using the same techstack(Vue & Django, additionally
        Django REST). Hutang here means debt.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        I needed an app to quickly track how much people owe me, so I made it.
        It is also the first application that has real world use for me(even
        till this day!).
